# What is this?
This is a test app for the official AIAnalytics application. It is a basic chatbot to test analysis features for our product.

# Running the Test App
To run, first do `cd aianalyticstestapp` to enter the actual app, then `npm install` to install the required modules, and finally `npm run dev` to run this app locally

For the time being, there is no web-based version of this application. It only runs locally for simplicity's sake.

# Using a .env
This project requires an OpenAI API key to work. To insert your own, create a .env.local in the `aianalyticstestapp/` directory (NOT root directory).
Insert it right after the equals sign as shown: `OPENAI_API_KEY=`
